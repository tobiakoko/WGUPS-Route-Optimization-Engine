# WGUPS-Route-Optimization-Engine

## Overview
The WGUPS Package Delivery System is a Python-based application designed to optimize the daily local deliveries for the Western Governors University Parcel Service. It aims to efficiently route and distribute packages while meeting specific delivery criteria and deadlines.

## Project Objectives
- Deliver 40 packages on time while meeting individual package requirements
- Keep the combined total distance traveled under 140 miles for both trucks
- Provide real-time tracking of truck and package status
- Develop a scalable solution applicable to multiple cities

## Key Features
- Self-adjusting algorithm for route optimization
- Custom hash table implementation for package data management
- User interface for real-time package status and delivery information
- Total mileage calculation for all trucks

## Technical Specifications
- **Language**: Python
- **Data Structures**: Custom Hash Table
- **Algorithm**: Nearest Neighbour

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Python Python3 is installed
3. Run `main.py` to start the application

## Data Files
- "Salt Lake City Downtown Map"
